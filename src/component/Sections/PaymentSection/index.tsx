         When you receive a payment for an order, we call that payment to you a "payout." Our secure payment system supports several payout methods, which can be set up below. Go to FAQ.

         To get paid, you need to set up a payout method releases payouts about 24 hours after a guestâ€™s scheduled time. The time it takes for the funds to appear in your account depends on your payout method.
